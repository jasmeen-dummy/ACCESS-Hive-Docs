# ACCESS-NRI Intake Catalogue

The ACCESS-NRI Intake Catalogue provides a Python interface to the collection of
climate data products that form the ACCESS Data Catalogue on _Gadi_.
For detailed information, Python tutorials and usage examples, please refer to the
[ACCESS-NRI Intake Catalogue documentation](https://access-nri-intake-catalog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Each catalogue entry corresponds to a different data product, where the columns describe the attributes associated with that product (e.g., available models, frequencies and data variables).
Users can filter or search these attributes to find the products relevant to their needs.
For example, a user could search for data products containing variables `X`, `Y` and `Z` at a `monthly` frequency.

The ACCESS-NRI Intake Catalogue also enables users to directly load the desired data in Python, without having to know the location or structure of the underlying files.

## Prerequisites
- **Join the _xp65_ NCI project**<br>
    The catalogue table files are in the `conda/analysis3` environment in _xp65_. Join the [xp65](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/xp65/join) project by requesting membership on its NCI project page.
- **Join any projects that has the data you're interested in.**

The easiest way to use the catalogue is through _JupyterLab_ on the [Australian Research Environment(ARE)](getting_started/are).


## Example: using the ACCESS-NRI Intake Catalogue to find, load and plot data with Python

We can plot an ocean variable called `temp_global_ave` for an [ACCESS-ESM1.5](/models/access_models/access-esm) run called `HI_CN_05` as follows:
```python
import intake
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the catalogue
catalog = intake.cat.access_nri

# This returns an Xarray Dataset
dataset = catalog["HI_CN_05"].search(variable="temp_global_ave").to_dask()

# Plot the data
dataset["temp_global_ave"].plot()
plt.title("")
plt.grid()
```
